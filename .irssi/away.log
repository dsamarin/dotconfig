12:21 ##Paws: 8/<g@>/elliottcableg8/>g eeboyjr: it also supports combining require()’d files into one compressed JS unit before serving it to the browser, and some other crap.
12:22 ##Paws: 8/<g@>/elliottcableg8/>g eeboyjr: i.e. it’s what `from` is/was, but with “normal” `require()` semantics instead of elliottcable-`from()` semantics
12:24 ##Paws: 8/<g >/devyng8/>g eelliottcable: eboyjr did already

07:40 #opus: 8/<g+>/gmaxwellg8/>g eeboy: until about a year ago, all vorbis encoders encoded multichannel as a set of totally uncoupled single channel encodings—  failing to perform higher order coupling is not the most efficient way to do multichannel, but there is nothing unreal about it.
07:42 #opus: 8/<g+>/gmaxwellg8/>g eeboy: moreover, they are not seperate streams at the container level— you hand a single packet to the opus decoder and you get 6 (or whatever) channel output.

18:03 8/<g</iniminog8/>g ethat is the site

18:12 8/<g</iniminog8/>g eThen based on what you find out about Amazon you can quote estimated hours for you to actually do the thing he wants, which is show the current best price on the page for each product

12:42 8/<g</sephrg8/>g enew project I'm starting (after this semester is over and I drop out)
12:42 8/<g</sephrg8/>g eI already have a bit of an outline but it's basically this:
12:44 8/<g</sephrg8/>g eoculus rift + https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTVPVobDrms + camera + a device that can be calibrated against eye muscles for low latency eye tracking + leap motion (pointed downwards so you don't have to lift your hands high)
12:44 8/<g</sephrg8/>g ecomplete ar/vr solution
12:44 8/<g</sephrg8/>g eI have $10-100k funding from my dad
12:44 8/<g</sephrg8/>g eif you want to get involved I can give you some funds to work on it and drop out of school
12:45 8/<g</sephrg8/>g ewe're going to do an oculus rift style kickstarter for it after we're done prototyping
12:45 8/<g</sephrg8/>g epcbs will be contracted from south korea or china
12:46 8/<g</sephrg8/>g eprobably a cortex a15 with a mali t6
12:47 8/<g</sephrg8/>g ein order to save batter life, eye tracking will be used so that only the portion of the screen you're focused on will be full res ui/graphics
12:47 8/<g</sephrg8/>g eand it decreases in res outwards according to human eye res info (on wikipedia & xkcd)
12:48 8/<g</sephrg8/>g eas for the look, we might want to hire someone to design it
12:48 8/<g</sephrg8/>g eand I will buy a http://store.makerbot.com/replicator2x.html to print out all of the designs
12:49 8/<g</sephrg8/>g efinal product should look like apple designed it so the mass production model will be CNCed

08:12 8/<g</sephrg8/>g eand I encode at 22fps so I can't do it in realtime and watch it

18:32 #oftn: 8/<g >/sephrg8/>g ethe only solution is to give eboy 'less omnipotence' (I know that doesn't make sense but you get what I'm saying) and let sephr keep full omnipotence
